csv2ofx

Running:

> python csv2ofx /path/to/csv

This will output the ofx file into the same folder of your csv file

This should work on both Windows and Linux.

Custom Mappings:

    csv2ofx gives preference to custom mappings over the built in mappings.
The builtin mappings (src/csv2ofx/mappings.py can be used as a template
for custom mappings.  You may copy the mappings.py file to your home
directory as csv2ofx_custom.py.  The file may also be placed in the current
working directory.  After creating a copy of the file, add or change the mappings
to suite your needs.  See mappings.py for mapping documentation.

Enjoy!
